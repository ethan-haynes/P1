## Usage
When using this page you will first land on the welcome spot of the main page. If you scroll down it will autoscroll and bring you to the main content of the page inside the body. This is where links to later projects are stored, as well as a little information about me. When you scroll back up, past the navigation, it will bring you to the main landing spot again.
